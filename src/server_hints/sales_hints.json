    "hint": "A Sales Order confirms a sale to a customer. It typically follows a Quotation and precedes a Delivery Note and Sales Invoice. Key fields include 'customer', 'transaction_date', 'delivery_date', and the 'items' table detailing products/services, quantities, and rates. Use this document to lock in the terms of a sale before fulfillment. When creating a Sales Order, ensure the customer details, item specifications, pricing, and delivery dates are accurate. The 'Grand Total' is calculated automatically based on item rates, quantities, and any applicable taxes or discounts."
