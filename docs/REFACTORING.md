# Frappe MCP Server Refactoring

## Overview

This refactoring improves the structure and error handling of the Frappe MCP Server codebase. The main goals were:

1. Break up the large `frappe-api.ts` file into smaller, more manageable modules
2. Improve error handling, especially for authentication errors
3. Make the code more maintainable and easier to understand

## File Structure Changes

The original `frappe-api.ts` file (1186 lines) has been split into the following modules:

- `errors.ts` - Contains the FrappeApiError class and error handling logic
- `api-client.ts` - Contains the Frappe API client setup
- `auth.ts` - Contains authentication-related functions
- `document-api.ts` - Contains document operations
- `schema-api.ts` - Contains schema operations
- `frappe-api.ts` - Now just re-exports from the other modules

## Error Handling Improvements

The error handling has been improved to better detect and report authentication errors:

- Better detection of invalid API key/secret errors
- Better handling of connection errors that might be related to authentication
- More detailed error messages and context
- Improved error reporting in the health check function

## Testing

A test script (`test-auth-error.js`) has been created to verify that the error handling works correctly with invalid credentials.

## Future Improvements

Some potential future improvements:

1. Add more comprehensive error handling for other types of errors
2. Add more unit tests for different error scenarios
3. Improve the documentation of the API
4. Add more logging to help with debugging
